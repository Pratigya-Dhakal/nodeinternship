JWT TOKEN whether to store in cookies or local storage
Pros of LocalStorage
Simplicity: The LocalStorage API is straightforward to use, making implementation easier.

Persistence: Data stored in LocalStorage remains available even after the user closes the browser or reboots the system.

Cons of LocalStorage
XSS attack: storing JSON web tokens in LocalStorage makes them susceptible to a XSS attack.

Lack of Encryption: LocalStorage does not provide built-in encryption, encrypted tokens make the stored data virtually inaccessible if an attacker gains access to the user's device.

Pros of cookies
Built-in Security: Cookies provide a built-in secure flag that allows only encrypted transmission over HTTPS.

Same-Origin Policy: Cookies are subject to the same-origin policy, which helps mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.

Options for Secure and HttpOnly Flags: By setting the secure flag and HttpOnly flag on cookies, you can enhance their security.

Cons of cookies
Complexity: working with cookies can be more complex compared to LocalStorage.

Limited Storage: cookies have a size limit of approximately 4KB, which may pose a constraint when storing large JWT tokens.


When it comes to storing JSON web tokens in the frontend, two primary concerns arise:

Protection against XSS attacks (cross-site scripting); and

Mitigation of token theft.
