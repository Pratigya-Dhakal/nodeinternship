Learning about file system in node js
 If the file doesn't exist the writeFileSync create the file and stores the data 
 if the file exist and we re write the data then it deletes the previous one and places the new one 
 if we want to add data without overriding it  we can use appendFileSync as we are working for synchronous ADDING data using append function
